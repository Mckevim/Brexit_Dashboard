Brexit in the media


This was a project for the module Data Visualisation and Data Management completed as part of an MSc.

The objective of this project was to gather, clean and visualise data from a number of news sources that contained the word Brexit.

The visualisation was complete by leveraging and learning from a template from Keen.io and the tutorial from Adil Moujahid http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2015/01/interactive-data-visualization-d3-dc-python-mongodb/
